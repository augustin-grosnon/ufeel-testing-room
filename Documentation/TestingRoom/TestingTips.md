# Testing & Debugging Tips

This guide outlines how to test and debug the **UFeel emotion detection package** across the main scenes in our demo project. These instructions are intended for developers evaluating how to integrate UFeel into their own Unity workflows.

## General Requirements

Before testing, make sure the following are in place:

- A **working webcam** with permissions granted (should be automatic but camera access might be asked at start).
- UFeel’s detection tools are correctly referenced in the emotion detection scene.
- No other software is blocking or monopolizing the webcam (e.g., Zoom, Teams).

## Emotion Detection Scene

**Scene Purpose:** Demonstrates UFeel's facial emotion recognition by gating player progression through doors.

### Testing Steps for Emotion Detection

- From the base scene, enter the **TestingRoom_EmotionDetection** scene via the carousel.
- The camera feed should activate automatically.
- Try displaying emotions like **happiness**, **surprise**, or **anger** as required by door labels.
- Doors will open only when the correct emotion is held for a sufficient time.

### Troubleshooting Emotion Detection

- **Emotion not recognized?**
  - Check for sufficient front-facing light.
  - Ensure your face is fully visible in the webcam's field of view.

- **Door doesn’t respond?**
  - Confirm `EmotionGameManager` is attached and listening to `UFeel` emotion data.

## Eye Tracking Scene

**Scene Purpose:** Controls a vehicle using gaze-based direction.

### Testing Steps for Eye Tracking

- From the base scene, enter the **TestingRoom_EyeTracking** scene via the carousel.
- Ensure the eye-tracking logic works (gaze affects vehicle direction).

### Troubleshooting Eye Tracking

- **Eye tracking not precise enough?**
  - Check for sufficient front-facing light.
  - Ensure your face is fully visible in the webcam's field of view.

## Base Scene (TestingRoom)

**Scene Purpose:** Main menu hub used to load other scenes additively.

### Testing Steps for Testing Room

- Run `BaseScene.unity`.
- Use the carousel to enter **EyeTracking** and **Emotion** scenes.
- Return to base between tests to ensure transitions preserve webcam availability.

### Troubleshooting Testing Room

- **Scene does not load**
  - Ensure all the scenes are referenced properly in the build settings.

## Tips

### Recommended Testing Practices

- Always test with a neutral face between expressions to avoid emotion confusion.
- Vary your facial expression intensity to check threshold tuning.
- Test with multiple people to evaluate detection robustness.
